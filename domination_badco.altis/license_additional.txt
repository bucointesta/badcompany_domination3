The following is not allowed, read strictly forbidden!

Uploading Domination to Steam Workshop is not allowed (only by myself)!!!!!

You are not allowed to monetize videos recorded/streamed while playing Domination in any form!!!!
(Non-commercial license, that's for you, youtube and twitch heroes. Make your own content if you want to make money and don't use other peoples work!!!)

Server owners are also not allowed to monetize their servers with perks or anything else when using/playing Domination!
(Again, non-commercial license!)

Additionally you are not allowed to use any of the Dom scripts/dialogs/images/whatever outside of the mission!
This is strictly forbidden!

It is also strictly forbidden for server host companys to sell or rent servers with the mission!!
(Non commercial license, not that hard to understand)

THIS MISSION IS Arma 3 only! Because no derivates are allowed it also means no port to any other game in the series is allowed!

PLEASE ALSO TRY TO NOT USE ANY DLC CONTENT WHICH IS RESTRICTED TO DLC OWNERS ONLY. THIS ONLY FRUSTRATS PLAYERS WHO DO NOT OWN THE DLC!!!!

You are free to edit the mission for your own server but you may not release the mission elsewhere (read the license!).
Furthermore you may not use servside addons with code from the mission or from your modded version. All code has to be in the mission.pbo!
